Series Overview
</h2>
<p style="margin-top:30px; font-family:Algerian; font-size:25; color:#B4B4B4; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px;">
The series is set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia,
a town charged with supernatural history since its settlement
of migrants from New England in the late 19th century.
It follows the life of Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev),
a teenage girl who has just lost both parents in a car accident,
as she falls in love with a 162-year-old vampire named Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley).
Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated as Stefan's mysterious older brother Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder) returns,
with a plan to bring back their past lover Katherine Pierce, 
a vampire who looks exactly like Elena. 
Although Damon is initially the villain and harbors a grudge against his brother for forcing him to become a vampire,
he later reconciles with Stefan and falls in love with Elena, creating a love triangle among the three.
Both brothers protect Elena as they face various villains and threats to their town, 
including Katherine. The brothers' history and the town's mythology are revealed through flashbacks as the series goes on.
Additional storylines revolve around the other inhabitants of the town, 
most notably Elena's younger brother Jeremy Gilbert (Steven R. McQueen),
her best friends Bonnie Bennett, (Kat Graham), and Caroline Forbes (Candice King),
their mutual friends Tyler Lockwood (Michael Trevino), and Matt Donovan (Zach Roerig),
and their history teacher, vampire hunter Alaric Saltzman (Matthew Davis). 
The town's politics are orchestrated by descendants of the original founding families, all comprising a "Founders' Council."
The founding families of Mystic Falls includes the Salvatores, the Gilberts, the Fells, the Forbes, and the Lockwoods.
They guard the town mainly from vampires,
although there are many more supernatural threats such as werewolves, witches, hybrids, ghosts and many more.

 the malevolent vampire brother who initially served as the show's anti-hero. 
 He is mostly thought of as selfish and manipulative, but later on in the series, 
 he begins to display a more caring side. Though his love for Elena is initially 
one-sided, she begins to develop feelings for him as they work together to save 
Stefan after he's given in to his ripper side. They begin dating in season 4, 
and continue to date (with some breakups along the way) until Elena is put into
 her deep sleep at the end of season 6. Damon is extremely close with Stefan,
 but also has a close relationship with Bonnie, despite the fact that they hated
 each other for the first 5 seasons of the series. Throughout seasons 6 and 7,
their relationship has developed into a deeper bond, with Damon later confirming Bonnie is his best friend.
